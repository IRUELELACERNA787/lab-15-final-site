                <p>At the very top of its structure exists the ever illusive Bastion Brain, but what of the minions beneath him which make up this city's Head? Of all five of its core pieces, some would say that the Right Eye is the worst of the bunch. An overzealous, dangerous, and frankly downright terrifying woman, her visage is that of nightmares. From her shoulderblade springs a shadow, corporeal and viscous, covered in eyes who sclera are filled with blood. An Angel of the most biblical proportions, all know that when she is called to arms, death will swiftly follow...</p>

                <p>From my setting known as <strong>The Ascent</strong>, Ciel vils Unia is a noblewoman of the country of Sulevi. She is a powerful magus with control over Gravity and is well known to be the bearer of an object known as a Divine Armament- a tool gifted to her by the deities of her faith: The Thirteen. She is a brash, headstrong sort of lass. Some look at her in awe of her presence and power, yet others look upon her with fear and disdain. One thing's for certain though, you don't want to be around when her short tempers' blown a fuse...</p>

                <p>This is a fanart piece! Aside from personal work, I also do stuff with the games I'm obsessed with. In this case, this is The Fourth Matchstick from Library of Ruina, by Project Moon. I highly recommend the game, it's an awesome game, I recall spending over 160 hours on the game over Winter Break.</p>
